# Practicum_project_8
 My eighth project from Practicum course. "How to Tell a Story Using Data"

 What was used in the project: Python, Jupyter notebook, PowerPoint. Libraries: pandas, numpy, plotly, matplotlib, seaborn, altair, usaddress.

# Project Description

I’ve decided to open a small robot-run cafe in Los Angeles. The project is promising but expensive, so I and my partners decide to try to attract investors. They’re interested in the current market conditions—will I be able to maintain my success when the novelty of robot waiters wears off?
I am an analytic, so my partners have asked me to prepare some market research. I have open-source data on restaurants in LA.

# Steps
1) Prepare data for analysis.
2) Data analysis.<br/>
    - Investigate the proportions of the various types of establishments. Plot a graph.
    - Investigate the proportions of chain and nonchain establishments. Plot a graph. Which type of establishment is typically a chain?
    - What characterizes chains: many establishments with a small number of seats or a few establishments with a lot of seats?
    - Determine the average number of seats for each type of restaurant. On average, which type of restaurant has the greatest number of seats? Plot graphs.
    - Plot a graph of the top ten streets by number of restaurants.
    - Find the number of streets that only have one restaurant.
    - For streets with a lot of restaurants, look at the distribution of the number of seats. Are there any trends?
3) Draw an overall conclusion and provide recommendations on restaurant type and number of seats. Comment on the possibility of developing a chain.
4) Preparing a presentation. Make a presentation of my research to share with investors.
